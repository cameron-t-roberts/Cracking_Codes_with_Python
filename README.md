# Cracking_Codes_with_Python
 

I am learning Python and version control with git. My career is cybersecurity, but cracking puzzles and programming have always interested me. 

I found Sweigarts book to be especially interested and I thought it would be fun to learn Python while breaking codes. 

I am using vim on a Red Hat 8 workstation as my primary text editor and environment. 

I am updating github via git in the terminal.
